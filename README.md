# Self Assessment Assignment  
### Self Assessment:
 During this project, I took on the techology design component and the overall dashboard application to present our data, learning, and findings to create a story about our dataset. For my role with technologies, I used what I learned in the class to decide on what technologies would be best for the data we have. I created a [technology diagram](https://github.com/AlexKrumins/Group5_Final_Project/blob/hannah-branch/Images/Group%20Project.png) to display my recommendations for the group. My biggest contribution to the project was the data dasboard featuring the key indicators of heart disease within the dataset, the data distrubtions that contributed to our unbalanced dataset, and an interactive map using country data in the KC Metro Area.  
 I assisted in other portions of the project as well. I helped with the dataset by defining what each characteristic meant from our Kaggle data. This was important to the group because it defines what each factor means, for example "smoker" could mean many different things. Doing a deep dive of the original dataset gave more insight on what we are actually looking at. I also provided privious knowledge with my background in biology. I suggested that we create bins based on actual meaningful data, thus we created our tables joins based on data from research based resources when creating categories based on "above, meets, and below sleep recommendations" as well as age risks.  
 My greatest personal challenge during the project was speaking up and asking questions. When I didn't understand a route we were taking, at first I had a hard time speaking up. Though as the project went on, I think when I did mention ideas or questions I had, it helped our project and helped me build confidence in myself.
